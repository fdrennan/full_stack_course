        Purpose of Website:
    </h3>

<p>
    I am taking a course on Udemy called <a href = 'https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/'>
    The Web Developer Bootcamp </a>. I am an R developer for <a href = "http://www.digitalfirstmedia.com/">
    Digital First Media</a> but would like to learn more about web development so that I can improve
    the applications I work on as well as grow as a programmer! If you would like to look at some of the
    projects I have worked on, please visit <a href = 'http://fdrennan.net'>fdrennan.net</a> for a
    list of R projects I have completed.
